# Morse Code Converter

Welcome to the **Morse Code Converter**! 😊 This project is a fun and interactive tool that transforms any string input into Morse code, making it easy to understand and use.

I was pleasantly surprised by how simple yet powerful it is, and I truly enjoyed creating this project.
